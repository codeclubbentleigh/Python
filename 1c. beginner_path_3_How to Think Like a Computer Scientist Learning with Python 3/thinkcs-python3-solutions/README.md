## About

I learned python using this awesome book when I was in 11th grade. 
I completed most of the exercises during that time. Pull requests are welcome if you find any mistakes. 

Note that some of the exercises require the use of the unit tester. You need to place a copy of 
[unit_tester.py](unit_tester.py) in your python's Lib directory for it to be loaded.
